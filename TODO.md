# Things to do

- association support for maps (specify key or based on associated entity id)
- naked non-entity type field should auto-map to Embedded
- association support for collections without an annotation
! ensure that Association entities are Effigy Entity annotated

! decouple the create/update method injection code for associations

! unit tests for row mappers and extractors

- add count/exists methods, and maybe a findOne that does not throw exception if not found

* implement @Ignored (ignored field) - or Transient

* support for finders

* test in real project scenarios

- annotation-driven validation support hooks
