# Things to do

* support for onetoone components as fields
    - finish impl
    - add new tests
! decouple the create/update method injection code for associations

! unit tests for row mappers and extractors

- add count/exists methods, and maybe a findOne that does not throw exception if not found

* implement @Ignored (ignored field) - or Transient

* support manytomany
* support maps as asociation containers

* support for finders

* test in real project scenarios
