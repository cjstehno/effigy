# Things to do

> This is just notes to myself - don't try to figure it out :-)

* update the site and documentation to reflect the new project scope
* now a single project with associated documentation projects - what is the best git/gradle layout for this?

* refactor annotation support (in general) to extract expressions rather than constants and then use those expressions in the code generation
* more documentation around the sql template language support
* document how users can modify the logger settings for the transforms
* should Effigy support query/result caching (spring-based)
* should Effigy support gmetrics around CRUD/SQL methods

* put anything left in this list (when refactoring done) into the project issues page
