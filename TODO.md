# Things to do

* Implement other associations
* Convert crud operation injection to be annotation-based so that you can pick and choose which you want

* convert the Column annotation to its own transformation - need to be careful since the property names need to be maintained
and we dont want other model properties to be modified by column annot or other applied annots
* consider a more layered approach to updating the model properties

* need to support default names for O2M association annotation
