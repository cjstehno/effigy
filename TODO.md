# Things to do

* support for onetoone components as fields

- use PreparedStatementSetters for param setting?
! decouple the create/update method injection code

- add count/exists methods, and maybe a findOne that does not throw exception if not found

* implement @Ignored (ignored field) - or Transient

* support onetoone - entity
* support manytomany
* support maps as asociation containers

* support for finders

* test in real project scenarios
