You can decide which definition above fits with your standard data-access experience.

Effigy is an annotation-driven simplification of JDBC that sits on top of the Spring JDBC library and allows a developer
to quickly develop data-access code for standard use cases, based on standard coding patterns.

Effigy is NOT a full-blown ORM.

Effigy is inspired by JPA and Spring-Data JPA and the desire to have similar functionality with simple JDBC-based projects.
